# Golang

> Notes and examples

Every Go program is made up of packages.

Programs start running in package main.

```go
package main

import (
"fmt"
"math"
"math/rand"
)

func main() {
fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}
```

> Note: The environment in which these programs are executed is deterministic, so each time you run the example program `rand.Intn` will return the same number. (To see a different number, seed the number generator; see [`rand.Seed`](https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/#Seed).

This code groups the imports into a parenthesized, "factored" import statement.

You can also write multiple import statements, like:

```go
import "fmt"
import "math"
```

## Exported names

In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter. For example, `Pizza` is an exported name, as is `Pi`, which is exported from the math package.

`pizza` and `pi` do not start with a capital letter, so they are not exported.

When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names. Any "unexported" names are not accessible from outside the package.

```go
package main

import (
"fmt"
"math"
)

func main() {
fmt.Println(math.Pi)
}
```

## Functions

A function can take zero or more arguments.

In this example, add takes two parameters of type int.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func add(x int, y int) int {
return x + y
}

func main() {
fmt.Println(add(42, 13))
}
```

> Notice that the type comes after the variable name. (For more about why types look the way they do, see the [article on Go's declaration syntax](https://blog.golang.org/gos-declaration-syntax).)

When two or more consecutive named function parameters share a type, you can omit the type from all but the last.

In this example, we shortened

```go
x int, y int

// to

x, y int

// resulting in:

func add(x, y int) int {
return x + y
}
```

A function can return any number of results.

The swap function returns two strings.

```go
func swap(x, y string) (string, string) {
return y, x
}

func main() {
a, b := swap("hello", "world")
fmt.Println(a, b)
}
```

### "Naked" return - Named return values

Go's return values may be named. If so, they are treated as variables defined at the top of the function.

These names should be used to document the meaning of the return values.

A return statement without arguments returns the named return values. This is known as a "naked" return.

```go
func split(sum int) (x, y int) {
x = sum * 4 / 9
y = sum - x
return
}

func main() {
fmt.Println(split(17))
}
```

Naked return statements should be used only in short functions, as with the example shown here. They can harm readability in longer functions.

## Variables

The var statement declares a list of variables; as in function argument lists, the type is last.

A var statement can be (scoped) at package or function level. We see both in this example.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var c, python, java bool

func main() {
var i int
fmt.Println(i, c, python, java)
}
```

Variables declared without a corresponding initialization are zero-valued. For example, the zero value for an int is 0.

The zero value is:

- 0 for numeric types,
- false for the boolean type, and
- "" (the empty string) for strings.

```go
func main() {
var i int
var f float64
var b bool
var s string
fmt.Printf("%v %v %v %q\n", i, f, b, s)
}
// Results in: 0 0 false ""
```

The `:=` syntax is shorthand for declaring and initializing a variable, e.g. for `var f string = "short"` in this case is same as `f := "short"`. Inside a function, the `:=` short assignment statement can be used in place of a var declaration with implicit type. Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the `:=` construct is not available.

A var declaration can include initializers, one per variable.

If an initializer is present, the type can be omitted; the variable will take the type of the initializer.

```go
var i, j int = 1, 2

func main() {
var c, python, java = true, false, "no!"
fmt.Println(i, j, c, python, java)
}

// Results in 1 2 true false no!
```

## Basic types

Go's basic types are

```go
bool

string

int  int8  int16  int32  int64
uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

byte // alias for uint8

rune // alias for int32
// represents a Unicode code point

float32 float64

complex64 complex128
```

The `int`, `uint`, and `uintptr` types are usually 32 bits wide on 32-bit systems and 64 bits wide on 64-bit systems. When you need an integer value you should use `int` unless you have a specific reason to use a sized or unsigned integer type.

```go
package main

import (
"fmt"
"math/cmplx"
)

var (
ToBe   bool       = false
MaxInt uint64     = 1<<64 - 1
z      complex128 = cmplx.Sqrt(-5 + 12i)
)

func main() {
fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", ToBe, ToBe)
fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", MaxInt, MaxInt)
fmt.Printf("Type: %T Value: %v\n", z, z)
}
```

### Type conversions

The expression T(v) converts the value v to the type T.

Some numeric conversions:

```go
var i int = 42
var f float64 = float64(i)
var u uint = uint(f)

// Or, put more simply:

i := 42
f := float64(i)
u := uint(f)

// Simple example:

func main() {
var x, y int = 3, 4
var f float64 = math.Sqrt(float64(x*x + y*y))
var z uint = uint(f)
fmt.Println(x, y, z)
}
```

Unlike in C, in Go assignment between items of different type requires an explicit conversion.

### Type inference

When declaring a variable without specifying an explicit type (either by using the := syntax or var = expression syntax), the variable's type is inferred from the value on the right hand side.

When the right hand side of the declaration is typed, the new variable is of that same type:

```go
var i int
j := i // j is an int
```

But when the right hand side contains an untyped numeric constant, the new variable may be an int, float64, or complex128 depending on the precision of the constant:

```go
i := 42           // int
f := 3.142        // float64
g := 0.867 + 0.5i // complex128
```

## Constants

Constants are declared like variables, but with the const keyword.

Constants can be character, string, boolean, or numeric values.

Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax.

```go
const Pi = 3.14

func main() {
const World = "世界"
fmt.Println("Hello", World)
fmt.Println("Happy", Pi, "Day")

const Truth = true
fmt.Println("Go rules?", Truth)
}
```

## Flow control

### For

Go has only one looping construct, the for loop.

The basic for loop has three components separated by semicolons:

- the init statement: executed before the first iteration

- the condition expression: evaluated before every iteration

- the post statement: executed at the end of every iteration

- 

The init statement will often be a short variable declaration, and the variables declared there are visible only in the scope of the for statement.

```go
func main() {
sum := 0
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
sum += i
}
fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

> Unlike other languages like C, Java, or JavaScript there are no parentheses surrounding the three components of the for statement and the braces { } are always required.

The loop will stop iterating once the boolean condition evaluates to false.

The init and post statements are optional:

```go
func main() {
sum := 1
for ; sum < 1000; {
sum += sum
}
fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

and at this point we can drop the semicolons:

```go
func main() {
sum := 1
for sum < 1000 {
sum += sum
}
fmt.Println(sum)
}
```

> Note the similarity with the while loop here

If you omit the loop condition it loops forever, so an infinite loop is compactly expressed:

```go
func main() {
for {
}
}
```

### If statements

Go's if statements are like its for loops; the expression need not be surrounded by parentheses ( ) but the braces { } are required.

```go
func sqrt(x float64) string {
if x < 0 {
return sqrt(-x) + "i"
}
return fmt.Sprint(math.Sqrt(x))
}
```

Like for, the if statement can start with a short statement to execute before the condition.

_Variables declared by the statement are only in scope until the end of the if. Variables declared inside an if short statement are also available inside any of the else blocks._

```go
package main

import (
"fmt"
"math"
)

func pow(x, n, lim float64) float64 {
if v := math.Pow(x, n); v < lim {
return v
} else {
fmt.Printf("%g >= %g\n", v, lim)
}
// can't use v here, though
return lim
}

func main() {
fmt.Println(
pow(3, 2, 10),
pow(3, 3, 20),
)
}
```
